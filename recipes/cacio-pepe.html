        This peasant food comes from Roman sheep herders who had little time and money to spend on eating.
        <br /> They used their sheep's cheese and a bit of the water that cooked the pasta to create a cream,
        <br /> then added black pepper to give it some extra flavor. Cheap, easy, and fast: This was perfect
        <br /> for them and for us even today!

    <h2>
        Ingredients:
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pound bucatini (dry)</li>
        <li>2 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place grated Pecorino Romano cheese into a large glass bowl and mix with a fork to make sure the cheese
            contains no lumps.</li>
        <li>Once the bucatini are al dente, lift them out with a spaghetti fork or tongs and put them directly into the
            bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much.</li>
        <li>Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed.</li>
        <li>Add more pasta water, little by little, until a thick cream has formed.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
